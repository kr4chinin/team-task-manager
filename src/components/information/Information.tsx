					This app allows you to coordinate command work. You can create
					accounts for your team members and give them various tasks. On the
					main screen (where user list is located) you will see how many tasks
					each user has and how many tasks he had yet completed. Number of
					completed tasks has <b>three color variations:</b>
				</p>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span className={cl.red}>Red</span> - user completed less then{' '}
						<b>50%</b> of tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						<span className={cl.yellow}>Yellow</span> - user completed{' '}
						<b>50%-80% </b>of tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						<span className={cl.green}>Green</span> - user completed more than{' '}
						<b>80%</b> of tasks
					</li>
				</ul>

				</p>
				<br />

					<li>
						<b>Search bar</b> - enter a string and you will see that tasks/users
						which don't have this string in the title/name will disappear from

						tasks/users title/name.
					</li>
